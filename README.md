# Prework Stufy Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to learn the basics of HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript to help me when the bootcamp begins.
I built this project to show the knowlege I have learnt thoughout the prework and to put my new skills into action.
It solves the problem of me not having previous knowledge and being able to go back to the notes/skills I have learnt.
I learnt how to use the different languages and also how to overcome issues that come up.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains notes about the topics we have covered. 
This can show us more information on topics such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
We can also see the JavaScript running when looking in the DevTools Console.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
